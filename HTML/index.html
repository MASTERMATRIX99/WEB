        <h1><B><i>MY SCHOOL</i></B></h1>
        <P>Understanding the situation of independence in 1976, some dedicated residents agreed to build an ideal educational
        institution with the aim of providing high-quality education to the children of this area. As a result of their efforts,
        perseverance and service, Mohammadpur Preparatory School and College has gained a reputation as one of the best
        educational institutions in Bangladesh in the past few decades. Starting with PG, KG and first grade, it gradually
        developed into a full-fledged high school with the efforts of entrepreneurs. In the continuation of its gradual
        development and expansion, entrepreneurs introduced eleventh grade at Mohammadpur Preparatory Girls College in 1993. In
        the past few decades, considering the advanced education system, pleasant environment, strict rules and discipline, this
        college has been able to occupy a respectable place among the high-quality colleges of Dhaka.
        
        
        
        To provide better education to the boys of this area, a college branch was opened at 3/3 Asad Avenue in 2004. In this
        college, the current generation of students are always striving to develop themselves as good citizens in an intensive,
        peaceful and pleasant environment.
        
        
        
        Here, qualified teachers try to develop the knowledge and mind of the students. Highly experienced, competent and PhD
        degree-holding professors are constantly trying to develop the knowledge of the students of this college. Regular
        training, seminars, workshops, etc. are organized for the teachers to improve teaching through modern education methods.
        
        
        
        Currently, this institution has departments of Science, Business Education and Humanities (in the girls' branch). Each
        department has various subjects including computer education as per the needs of the present century. There is a
        well-established computer center, a library with sufficient books, advanced laboratories and a medical center.
        
        
        
        With the sincere efforts of the teachers, there are ample opportunities to achieve success in the pursuit of knowledge.
        Apart from textbooks, there are arrangements for knowledge practice, sports and other co-curricular activities. There
        are special scholarships and other facilities for talented students.
        
        
        
        The college authorities are always striving to maintain an improved education system, sound management, and a clean
        environment in the institution. An environment suitable for talent development is the specialty of this educational
        institution.
        
        
        
        In this continuity, with the combination of the authorities' labor, talent and thinking, a project was prepared in 1996
        to establish a university and an application was made for government approval. After 5 years of long efforts, Bangladesh
        University was established in 2001 and received government permission to start classes. Arrangements have been made for
        the students of this institution to study at Bangladesh University at a 30% lower cost.
